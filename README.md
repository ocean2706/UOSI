UOSI
====

This is an universal OS installer targeting linux and bsd like distributions.

Planning stage

It is required because i found  fedora has no options for what i need for, arch os neither.

Each distribution has his own installer but i feel uncomfortable with the install os and choices.

Inspired from debian , manjaro, ubuntu, archlinux and others
